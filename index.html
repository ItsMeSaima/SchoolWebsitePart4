<h4>New School Canteen</h4>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organized and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus 
with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents 
make the right nutritional choices. each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track  
of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirments they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can  
eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
Here again, disversity is the key.</p>

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

  1. Accuracy- Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
  management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data   
  entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
<br><br>
2. Economics- Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end 
to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter
of fact, a study done by the Assium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated 
attedance management systems.
<br><br>
3. Productivity / Efficiency- Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming. 
laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to proccess paper sheets and time cards, create
schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an
automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information
into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy help in optimizing the use of resources which lead to
increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like Visibility / Insights, Hassle Free workflow Management, Flexbility, 
Integration / Configuration, Real-time tracking, Security, and Compliance.</p>
